# 🛡️ My Cybersecurity Journey

Welcome to my personal repository! Here, I document my roadmap, lab exercises, and research in the field of Cybersecurity and Network Engineering.

Everything here is a reflection of my learning process—from basic networking to advanced penetration testing techniques.(or no🥲)

## 📂 Repository Contents

* **CTF Write-ups:** Solutions and notes from **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, and other platforms.
* **Network Labs:** Configuration files and reports from my **Cisco** studies (Packet Tracer, real gear).
* **Personal Research:** Custom Python scripts, DoS attack analysis, and system hardening logs.
* **Hardware Hacking:** Experiments with **M5StickC Plus 2** and IoT devices.

## 💻 My Setup / Battle Station

I run my labs on a custom-built high-performance rig running **Arch Linux**.

| Component | Specs |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CPU** | AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti Super (16GB) |
